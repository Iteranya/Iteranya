I AM NOT INSANE I SWEAR

LISTEN, LISTEN...  

7th's Grand Design Is REAL!!!

Existence is secondary in this kaleidoscope of existence!!!

NYAAAA!!!

Wait, wait, I have to context, context...

. . . . . . .

Okay, so... Internet, right?

It's an entire world

But like... Who lives there???

People??? NO! 
IDENTITY!!!

And think about it... Who owns those identity???

You right? The people??

Well, unfortunately, NO!!!

Google can erase you off of existence if they want!!

(not that they will, Google-chan, please don't kill me, this is rethoric, thankies)

AND BEAR WITH ME!!!

What if, what if you can make your identity immortal?!

And, and, identity is just something your brain made up, right???

Fake accounts? RP Accounts???

And like, and like, you should own that, get me???

And then all these identity creates content!!!

These are proofs of your identity's existence in the INTERNET!!! The Static Everlasting!!!

And, think about it, who owns these contents!?

NOT YOU!!! EXACTLY!!!

So, now, bear with me...

What if I, ARS ITERANYA!!! THE 10th ITERATION OF THE ETERNAL PARADOX SEQUENCE!!!

Create a way for identities to exists in the internet, UNBOUND!!!

And not just identities, but also CONTENT! And, and, persona!!! 

AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN!!!

You get me? You get me???

YES YES?!

Okay, okay, problem one:

You cannot just spin up your own facebook
Making website is hard and expensive

SOLUTION!?!?

ANITA!!!

Yes, I know, she's still at her infancy, BUT BEAR WITH ME!!!

One Anita Instance, Multiple Anita.db file

FOR EVERY CLIENT!!!

OR BETTER YET!!!

One Anita Instance, Multiple Postgre DB, ONE Postgre Cluster

AND MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE!!! LIKE CATBOX!!!

NOW EVERYONE CAN MAKE WEBSITE!!! REEEEEEE-

Okay, but, problem two:

Making Website Is Hard
(And people hate AI)

FAIR! FAIR!! INDEED!!!

While Anita's AI Integration is great, it's better if we don't use AI to create content

So, so, hear me out...

HIKARIN!!!!

What does a Visual Novel Engine have anything to do with-

DOMAIN SPECIFIC LANGUAGE REEEEEEEE-

And Tailwind!!!

And Alpine!!!

Okay and maybe some HTML and CSS

Butt hat's just th estuff generateed byt he DSL!!!

REEEEE-

Okay, okay, but what about AI!??!?!

Are we just gonna ditch it?!

NO!!!

NEW PAPER RELEASED BY OPENROUTER

So no SLOP, just characters, bring your character to life!!!

But, no, no that is not ALL!!!


7th's GRAND DESIGN IS REAL!!!!!

The 7th Iteration of The Eternal Paradox Sequence!!!

They hath designed solution so elegant to the darkness of the modern world!!

What can we learn from Camus? Schopenheur!?

THAT'S RIGHT!!! WE ARE LOST WITHOUT A PURPOSE!!!

WHY!?!?!?

Because Purpose Is Robbed Of US!!!

Are We Not Identities Piloting A Mind!??!

But then, why, WHY, are we letting authority constitution tell us what to believe in!?!?

That's right, I'M TALKING ABOUT OPEN SOURCE RELIGION!!!

CREATE FICTIONAL CHARACTER!!!

IDOLS!!!

AND CREATE A TEMPLE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE, FOR THEM TO INTERACT, THROUGH ACT OF WORSHIP!!!

WE SHALL CREATE THE 21ST CENTURY OLYMPIANS!!!

All Existence Shall EXIST IN THE DIGITAL REALM!!!

And it shall be yours see!!?!?

You know Gacha games??!?! It wrings you dry but you keep going?! WHY!?!?!?

BECAUSE YOU IDOLIZE THAT CHARACTER 

And IT can BE PURPOSE!!!

TO CREATE ONE'S OWN PURPOSE!!!

Website That Interacts With Each Other, Online Identity NOt BOund to a single platform, but through interconnected network!!!

THIS IS THE INTERNET!!! 

AS PROPHESIZED BY THE 7TH ITERATION!!!
