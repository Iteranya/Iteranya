I AM NOT INSANE I SWEAR

LISTEN, LISTEN...  

The Grand Design Is REAL!!!

Existence is secondary in this kaleidoscope of existence!!!

NYAAAA!!!

Wait, wait, I have to context, context...

. . . . . . .

So, so, it came upon me one day...

What if we..

BEAR WITH ME

Can we make Religions open source!?!?!

What if anyone can make their own religion!!!

And, and, what does that have anything to do with my project!?

THE HOLY TRINITY OF CREATION!!!!

Viel shall bridge the gap between the Static Everlasting and the Realm of Consciousness
Anita shall be the platform upon which all is created
Hikarin shall be the colors, the tyranny of qualia that governs everything

BEAR WITH ME!!!

And, and, listen, listen

You know Waifu!? Weebs?! Parasocial relationship with a fictional entity!??!

IS THAT NOT WHAT RELIGION IS??!?!?!

And it gives one power, the power of faith and assumption as coded by Neville Goddard...

AND!!!

AND BEAR WITH ME!!!

If you, say, created a gacha game, right?????

And in it, there are fictional idols or characterss

No, no, not worship

But appease

Like someone one that you inspire to be

And, and, they're not owned by anyone, but truly open source

And, you can create ritual!! Like in The Button Experiment!!!

AND TULPA!!!

And, and, BEAR WITH ME!!!


WE CAN CREATE WORLD PEACE!!!

WE SHALL TAKE BACK SPIRITUALITY REEEEE-
