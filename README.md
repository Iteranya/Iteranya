It's been a long time since I updated this...

## Now Where Was I?

Right, right, the uhhh... Aina V2...

Things have changed, a lot...

I have three, uhh, 'Flagship' project now.

[Viel-chan](https://github.com/Iteranya/viel-ai), [Anita-chan](https://github.com/Iteranya/anita-cms), [Hikarin-chan](https://github.com/Iteranya/hikarin-framework)

All three of them are, how do I say this... My legacy, it defines everything I stood for.

## A Programmer???

***Absolutely Not***

To call me a programmer is like calling an architect a construction worker.

I don't write code, I design software and get AI to do the coding.

I supervise and debug and refine and maintain.

And I have strict standard on how the app should work.

In fact, I happily say that I don't follow tech news nonsense.

- Rust is something that happens to iron due to oxidation
- Go is a verb used when something begins
- React is another verb similar to the word 'act'
- Javascript is a language you use with HTML and CSS to make website interactive\
- Python is a programming language
- Linux is a headless operating system used for servers
- AI is a neat tool that makes you boiler plate code, writes CSS, roleplay for you

## Vibe Coder?

Do I Vibe Code? Yes
Am I Responsible For My Code? Yes

Listen, I don't judge code by what framework, who made it, etc, etc

I judge project by 3 things, and 3 things only

- **Maintanability**: If a bug takes 5 weeks to fix, you failed to make a maintainable code
- **Ease of Use**: If it's hard to use, you failed to make good product
- **License**: Is it Open Source or Proprietary? (Open Core counts as the latter)

And I judge developer by 3 things and 3 things only

- **Responsibility**: Are you willing to put time and effort to maintain the project and fix bugs as it comes along?
- **Generosity**: Are you driven to help and empower people or for profit or for both?
- **Empathy**: Do you understand your users or do you assume the average joe knows what a 'docker' is?

## Expertise?

Systems Architect, Local Systems Architect specifically

I can prototype fast even before AI, even faster now with AI

And all my prototype has solid architectural decision, scaling up and fixing bugs become trivial

Adding into my project, refining them, is also trivial

I don't use Copilot you see? I prefer copy pasting things to Web AI, and then figure out how to implement what it spits out.

## Why Be Proud Of AI Generated Code?

**I am not proud of the code**

I am happy with the result~

With Anita, next time I have web dev commission, I don't have to wrestle with Paid Plugins and Paid Themes anymore
With Viel, I don't have to worry about cluttering my discord server with a thousand AI Bots for that RP experience
With Hikarin, I have an easy way to make Visual Novel inside of minecraft and get scriptwriter with zero coding experience to write scripts for me.

The result is all that matters. As long as Anita, Viel, and Hikarin are maintainable and easily debugged and improved upon.

I am not complaining.

## Why Code?

To make things that don't exist or make an open source alternative to something that gets paywalled to oblivion.

In other words...

*I Code Out Of Spite*

Except for Hikarin, I code Hikarin because I want to turn minecraft into an Eroge.

...

I have no regrets.
