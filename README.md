## Welcome

This will be a wall of text, apologies for that. I'm still learning the art of doocumentation.

### My Thinking Style

But anyways, a little something about me.

```
Abstract
|      | -> Philosophers, Linguists, Artists
|  Me  |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      | -> Engineers, Programmers, Researchers
Concrete
```
I am currently about that high on the Abstraction Scale. 
I like to think of myself as pragmatic, but I rarely think too much in concrete terms.
I try to tone down on abstraction, but my words can be a bit too vague sometimes.

### Development

I see programming as another way to create things. Comparable to woodworking and drawing.
I have no 'preferred' way to do programming or paradigm to follow.
I do what is easiest to create the thing I wish to make.

I have a home server running Linux, but I use  Windows for my development and general purpose needs.
For me, Linux is a specialized tool, not a general purpose tool or  workspace.

I would use AI to write codes for me. I don't mind, as long as they get things done.
Mostly for boiler plates code and refactoring.
If I can understand the code AI make, I can put it in with no worries.

I am leaning on OOP now to structure my more complex project. 

### Artificial Intelligence

AI as of right now makes a good toy.
All of my AI Projects are designed to be used for amusement, not professional use.

Stable Diffusion and Image Generation AI were created to replace Artists and Hummans, that's my stance on it.

I scorn people who slap AI into their product and calling it 'AI Powered', using it as an excuse to layoff employees, and replace humans.
It doesn't matter how advanced AI gets, it still lacks one thing. 'Accountability'
No AI Companies want to be held accountable for the mistake their AI makes and that, to me, should be enough reason not to use it for professional use.

AI is best used for novel toy to play with, not a tool to replace professional.
People hire professionals for accountability, not just expertise.

### Other Hobbies

I make Video Essays on Youtube, Write Things in Web Novel, and such.

Also cooking.
