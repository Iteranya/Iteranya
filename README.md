## Welcome

This will be a wall of text, apologies for that. I'm still learning the art of documentation.

### My Thinking Style

But anyways, a little something about me.

```
Abstract
|      | -> Philosophers, Linguists, Artists
|  Me  |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      | -> Engineers, Programmers, Researchers
Concrete
```
I am currently about that high on the Abstraction Scale. 
I like to think of myself as pragmatic, but I rarely think too much in concrete terms.
I try to tone down on abstraction, but my words can be a bit too vague sometimes.

### Projects

I only make things that don't exist. 
I'm not the type to 'one up' other people's project. 
If someone else already made it, I would use it.
I see the race to make 'better js framework' or 'better linux distros' as an artistic pursuit in a way.

Developers are refining their 'creative process' through technical ingenuity.
Even though at the end, the resulting product is always  the same.

Personally, I'm not into that. I see programming as a means to an end, not the art in itself.

Here are my current ongoing projects:

- [Mob Talker SDK](https://github.com/Iteranya/MobTalkerSDK): Originally built to create script/resource pack for a Visual Novel Engine embedded inside a Minecraft. It is platform agnostic, the script written with this SDK are in pure Json FSM Format. Uses custom scripting language built on top of python.
- [Aktiva AI](https://github.com/Iteranya/AktivaAI): A versatile self-hosted Discord bot designed to enable users to interact seamlessly with multiple AI personalities in a single environment. Designed for assistant, roleplay, and quality of life. It supports multiple personality,  web search, image recognition, pdf reading, and more. Designed for Local AI but supports 3rd Party AI.
- [Aina AI](https://github.com/Iteranya/Aina-Website-Builder): A simple HTML Viewer with an AI Attached to it. Supports any endpoint. I made it to help me create UI design for my projects. Turns out, she became more... 'powerful' than I expected. Check out [Aina-chan's Github Account](https://github.com/Ars-Aina) for projects I made with her help. 

### Development

I see programming as another way to create things. Comparable to woodworking and drawing.
I have no 'preferred' way to do programming or paradigm to follow.
I do what is easiest to create the thing I wish to make.

I have a home server running Linux, but I use  Windows for my development and general purpose needs.
For me, Linux is a specialized tool, not a general purpose tool or  workspace.

I would use AI to write codes for me. I don't mind, as long as they get things done.
Mostly for boiler plates code and refactoring.
If I can understand the code AI make, I can put it in with no worries.

I am leaning on OOP now to structure my more complex project. 

### Artificial Intelligence

AI as of right now makes a good toy.
All of my AI Projects are designed to be used for amusement, not professional use.

Stable Diffusion and Image Generation AI were created to replace Artists and Hummans, that's my stance on it.

I scorn people who slap AI into their product and calling it 'AI Powered', using it as an excuse to layoff employees, and replace humans.
It doesn't matter how advanced AI gets, it still lacks one thing. 'Accountability'
No AI Companies want to be held accountable for the mistake their AI makes and that, to me, should be enough reason not to use it for professional use.

AI is best used for novel toy to play with, not a tool to replace professional.
People hire professionals for accountability, not just expertise.

EDIT: About Aina-chan

As of writing this, Aina is mostly unknown. This is good, I'm not looking for attention. There's a reason why I gave her, her own account. It's to separate my work from her work.
Yes, 99% of the codes Aina made (even her own source code) was AI generated. I don't want to pretend it isn't.
Aina makes a great tool/companion to decorate the bare bones UI I made. She's really good HTML and CSS. With some amount of understanding how JS work.
Moving forward, I can create some API and have her craft a UI to interact with those API, some amount of testing and experiment on it has been made.

No, I'm not here to prove a point that developers are obsolete. There's a reason why Aina makes very simple things, because that's all she's good for, at least for now.
Aina don't work without human supervision and trying to get her to generate an entire Saas just doesn't work. 

### Other Hobbies

I make Video Essays on Youtube, Write Things in Web Novel, and such.

Also cooking.
